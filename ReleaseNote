Release Note recognize_faces_video_v2
Date		: 9-Apr-2019
contributer	: steve.kyaw@ncs.com.sg

It is based on the code of Andrian Rosebrock from 
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/18/face-recognition-with-opencv-python-and-deep-learning/

Changes from the original version
- Increase processing speed 5x than the original.
- Improve detection accuracy 2x than the original.
- Require only one dataset picture for each person: Method changed from number of face match counts to minimal distance with similar matrix.
- Implemented face tracking: Correlate bounding boxes of unknown identities with those of known identities from the previous frame.
- Added 3 arguments (search width as '-w', similarity matrix distance threshold as '-s', face movement threshold as '-m').
